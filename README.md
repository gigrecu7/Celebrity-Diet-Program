# Celebrity-Diet-Program
This was my first project using computer programming language. This program is done in Python and it was a light-hearted program created for users to find out the diets of a set amount of actors/celebrities and see if the diet would work for them. Users choose from one of the actors listed in the program and they will get all the diet information for that actor based on their height, weight, and age that they will input. Based on the inputs the program will let the user know if the diet is healthy for them or a risk for them to try. A Separate txt. file was created to call on where all the nutritional info of the celebrity diets are.
